# About

This project is my submission for the weekly challenge: https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-8-ultimate-tic-tac-toe

For some reason that week's challenge have reminded me of a cool project I have seen some time ago - [pointerpointer.com](https://pointerpointer.com/)
I have really liked that website back in the day.
Turns out nowadays it is a pure React app, so I kinda was able to replicate it on Github pages without any issues.

For ultimate tic-tac-toe part I also have decided not to bother myself too much and just used someone else's code (under Creative Commons license) as an inspiration: I just tried several implementations and ended up copying code which I felt was organized the best.
